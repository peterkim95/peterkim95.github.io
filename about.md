My name is Peter Kim and I am currently a graduate student at UCLA, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. As a deep learning researcher and enthusiast, I am certain that neural networks will fundamentally change industries, especially healthcare (reactive to preventative) and transportation (manned to autonomous). In the future, I hope to one day build a decentralized hospital (look out for a blog post about this coming soon...)
